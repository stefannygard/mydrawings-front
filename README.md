mydrawings-front
================

Angular frontend for a drawing app. Made for learning how to use Angular together with KineticJS, and a Laravel Backend (the backend repo: [mydrawings-back](https://github.com/stefannygard/mydrawings-back)). Much of the Authentication and security is based on [end-to-end-with-angularjs](https://github.com/davemo/end-to-end-with-angularjs), see comments in code.
